# Java Array Functions  

This repository contains a simple Java program that performs the following operations on an array:  
- **User Input Handling**: Takes 5 integers as input from the user.  
- **Odd-Even Separation**: Splits the input array into odd and even numbers.  
- **Minimum Difference Calculation**: Finds the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the array.  

## Program Structure  

### 1. `Main.java`  
This is the entry point of the program. It:  
- Creates instances of `UserInput` and `ArrayFunctions`.  
- Takes user input and processes the array.  
- Calls functions to compute and display results.  

### 2. `UserInput.java`  
Handles user input by:  
- Prompting the user to enter 5 integers.  
- Storing them in an array and returning it.  

### 3. `ArrayFunctions.java`  
Defines methods to:  
- **Separate odd and even numbers**: Categorizes numbers into separate lists.  
- **Find the minimum difference**: Determines the smallest difference between consecutive numbers.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Compile the Java files using `javac Main.java UserInput.java ArrayFunctions.java`.  
3. Run the program using `java Main`.  
4. Enter 5 numbers when prompted.  
5. View the results of odd-even separation and minimum difference calculation.
